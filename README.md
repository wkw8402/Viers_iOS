## Design Mockup for Viers iOS Application

### Problem Domain
Efficiency / Student-led

### Problem Overview
It was difficult to check how crowded study spots, RSF, and cafes were before actually going to these places.
Libraries, MLK Building, RSF are too crowded
RSF Crowd Level Website is not very accurate
Waste of time and energy to just find a good study space before studying.

### Solution Overview
Centralize the checking and uploading of crowd level in one app and Firebase engine that centers the popular spots within university
Use the app as a community-driven initiative to improve the overall efficiency of traveling within University.
Use the app as way of recommending spots because app is based on location and university (school email logins), all less crowded suggestions should be beneficial
Add in a messaging feature within the app to help with ascertaining the level of crowd
